This is a very basic text editor.

pwd: print working directory
ls: list files
cd: change directory
mkdir: make a new directory
.. : dropping a level
~ : home area (great for making a script and can assume directory of the other person)
*  : anything that is in this search (Ex: *.csv (anything .csv))
RM: removing EVERYTHING in this directory
nano: text editor

ssh -i "~/Downloads/Leaf.pem" ubuntu@ec2-34-211-12-176.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

scp -i "~/Downloads/Leaf.pem" my_notes.txt ubuntu@ec2-34-211-12-176.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/work/.
